# Frankenquines

This is a collection of quines that construct another program. I've
broken them into two sub-categories: traditional and pseudo. A
*traditional* frankenquine creates another program from snippets of code
taken from either itself, or from the source code of the language used. A
*pseudo* frankequine creates another program from source code stored in
one place, rather than gathering parts of the source code from various
places.

## [Traditional](traditional)

* [Hello World in Go](traditional/go/hello-world-go)

## [Pseudo](pseudo)

* [Hello World in C](pseudo/go/hello-world-c)
* [Web Server in Go](pseudo/go/web-server-go)
