# Quines: Self-Reproducing Programs

This is a repository containing different implementations of
self-reproducing programs. It is not meant to be a showcase of various
languages, but rather a showcase of different implementations/styles in
the languages I primarily use.

## What is a quine?

Ken Thomposon describes a quine in his paper [*Reflections on Trusting
Trust*](https://github.com/oglinuk/ken-thompsons-rott-quine/blob/master/rott.pdf)
as, "More precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program
that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of
its source."
