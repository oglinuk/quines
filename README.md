# Quines: Self-Reproducing Programs

This is a repository containing different implementations of
self-reproducing programs. It is not meant to be a showcase of various
languages, but rather a showcase of different implementations/styles in
the languages I primarily use.

## What is a quine?

Ken Thomposon describes a quine in his paper [*Reflections on Trusting
Trust*](https://github.com/oglinuk/ken-thompsons-rott-quine/blob/master/rott.pdf)
as, "More precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program
that, when compiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of
its source."

## TODO

* [ ] Implement a [basic quine](basic)
	* [X] [C](basic/c)
	* [X] [Go](basic/go)
	* [X] [Python 3](basic/python)
	* [ ] C++
	* [ ] BASH
	* [ ] JavaScript

* [ ] Implement a [self-compiling quine](self-compiling)
	* [X] [C](self-compiling/c)
	* [X] [Go](self-compiling/go)
	* [ ] Python3
	* [ ] C++
	* [ ] BASH
